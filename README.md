# ITLINKSHARE project

**itLinkShare** is a global project of sharing resources across teammates or friends interested in the same kind of data.
The main purpose is to link users to an organisation, each organisation is handled by one or more admins that can manage folders and resources.

Each user has the possibility to comment and upvote/downvote a resource or a link. The main goal is to gather all the important links and information all members of the organisation should know.

The project is divided into two main components :

* The server part (WIP)
* The mobile application (TO DO)

## The server part (WIP)

This part is mainly an API that is used by the mobile app to enable the sharing between all users. Each user, connected to an organisation will be able to gather the folders and resources that he is authorized to see.
